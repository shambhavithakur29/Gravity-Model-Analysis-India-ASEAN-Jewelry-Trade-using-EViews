# Gravity-Model-Analysis-India-ASEAN-Jewelry-Trade-using-EViews
Applied and studied gravity model on India-ASEAN jewelry trade to analyse the impact of a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the two.

## Data and Methodology
Cross section unit = ASEAN countries namely Brunei Darussalam, Burma, 
Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and 
Vietnam. <br>
Time series units = 2006 to 2020 i.e. a period of 15 years <br>
Thus, the total no of observation being 15*10 = 150 <br>

The regression gravity equation is as follows: <br>
(ln_Exports from India to ASEAN) = 𝛃0(ln_GDP of India) + 𝛃1(ln_GDP of ASEAN) - 𝛃2(ln_distance between India and ASEAN) + 𝛃3Dummy_time + u

## Observations
GDP boosts exports by 2.6% while post-FTA exports fell due to diversion and compliance costs.
